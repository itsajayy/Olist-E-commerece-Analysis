# Olist-E-commerece-Analysis

### OverView

  Olist is a Brazilian e-commerce platform that connects small and medium-sized businesses to customers across Brazil. The platform operates as a marketplace, where merchants can list their products and services and customers can browse and purchase them online.

### Dataset Description

The dataset used for this challenge was pulled from [KAGGLE](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) . It contains information on 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allow viewing orders from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment, and freight performance to customer location, product attributes, and finally reviews written by customers.

For this challenge, I used SQL to access the dataset, clean and perform Exploratory Data Analysis.
